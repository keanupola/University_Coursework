# Chess AI with MinMax Algorithm

## Project Description

This project is a Python program that implements a simple chess AI using the MinMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. The AI can play against a human player, making decisions based on a depth-limited search of possible moves.

## Running on Google Colab

## Features

- **Game Logic**: Full implementation of chess rules, including movement, captures, check, and checkmate.
- **AI Opponent**: Computer player uses the MinMax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for optimal move selection.
- **User Interface**: Command-line interface for interactive gameplay.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python 3
- **Libraries**: `numpy`, `sys` (and any other required libraries)
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` file)

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system
- Required Python libraries installed (`numpy`, etc.)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/keanupola/University_Coursework.git
```

### Navigate to the Project Directory:
```bash
cd University_Coursework/Highlights/Chess_AI_with_MinMax
```

### Install Required Libraries (if not already installed):
```bash
pip install numpy
```

## Running the Program
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook CS3793_assignment2_tro893.ipynb
```

### Run the Notebook:
- Execute the cells in order to initialize the game and start playing.
- Follow the on-screen prompts to make your moves.
