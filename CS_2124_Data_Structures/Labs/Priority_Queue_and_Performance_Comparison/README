For this lab you will write your own main.c file. Your main.c file will
do the following:

1. Write the code that will init both a heap and a priority queue that
was implemented with a linked list. The code that implements these is already provided.

2. Using your priority queue you initialized you will conduct 3 separate time measurements. 
Measure how long it takes to enqueue 1000 nodes, 10000 nodes, 
and 100000 nodes in seconds. Print your results to the terminal. (you can do more if you like)
The priority that is used to enqueue each node should be a random int between 0-99.

3. Repeat step 2 with the heap you initialized.

There is a sample main.c file that illustrates how to use the time.h library for time measurement 
as well as demonstrating how to use the rand() function call.

Turn in your output for all your time measurements as a text file. 
(you do not need to turn in your code)
