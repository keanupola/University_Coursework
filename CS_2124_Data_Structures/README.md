## Course Description
Covers data structures such as binary search trees, heaps, queues, stacks, and their implementation in C. Emphasis on algorithms and efficiency.

## Assignments
- **Binary Search Trees and Traversals**: Implement tree operations and traversals.
- **File I/O and String Manipulation**: Work with file operations and manipulate strings.
- **Stacks and Binary Search**: Implement stack operations and binary search algorithms.

## Labs
- **Heap Implementation**: Create and manipulate heaps.
- **Priority Queue**: Compare performance of different queue implementations.
